ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Build a model to predict gold prices based on historical data.

Use PySpark MLlib to handle large-scale data and train a regression model.

Demonstrate how to create lag features (previous daysâ€™ prices) to predict the current dayâ€™s price.

ðŸ›  Environment Requirements

You need to install the following tools:

Python 3.x

Apache Spark (PySpark)

Python libraries:

pyspark

numpy

matplotlib

Dataset file: gold_prices.csv (should be placed in the same directory or adjust the file path accordingly).

ðŸ“– Main Workflow in the Notebook

Initialize SparkSession for PySpark operations.

Load the CSV file containing gold price data (Date, Buy Price, Sell Price).

Preprocess the data:

Convert Date column to date format.

Rename columns with spaces.

Sort data by time.

Feature engineering: add columns lag_1 â€¦ lag_10 (gold prices of the previous 10 days).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (70:30).

Train a Linear Regression model to predict gold prices.

Evaluate the model using metrics (RMSE, RÂ²).

Visualize results by comparing predicted vs. actual gold prices.

âœ… Results

The linear regression model successfully predicts the trend of gold prices based on historical data.

Performance is evaluated using RMSE and RÂ² to verify accuracy.

Visualization clearly shows the gap between predicted and actual prices.

ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

Try other models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees.

Add more features such as: Sell Price, Buy/Sell difference, day of week, monthâ€¦

Apply additional time series techniques (ARIMA, LSTM) for comparison with PySpark MLlib.
